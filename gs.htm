  <p class="title"><a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2015/12/10/roads-to-rome-project/">“Roads to Rome” Project</a></p>
  <p class="info">geoMusings<br />Dec 10, 2015 04:35 AM</p>
  <p><p>I got an interesting e-mail the other day informing me about the &#8220;<a href="http://roadstorome.moovellab.com/">Roads to Rome</a>&#8221; project. I don&#8217;t normally write items that arrive in my inbox, but this had two major hooks for me. First, I used to do a lot of routing analysis earlier in my career. Second, I am a Roman history buff. With these two factors in play, I couldn&#8217;t resist.</p>
<div id="attachment_3503" style="width: 710px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="imgCenter wp-image-3503 size-large" src="http://i1.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/0-Roads-to-Rome.jpg?resize=700%2C438" alt="Image courtesy moovel lab team, Data © OpenStreetMap contributors" srcset="http://i1.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/0-Roads-to-Rome.jpg?resize=300%2C188 300w, http://i1.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/0-Roads-to-Rome.jpg?resize=768%2C480 768w, http://i1.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/0-Roads-to-Rome.jpg?resize=1024%2C640 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" data-recalc-dims="1" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Image courtesy moovel lab team, Data © OpenStreetMap contributors</p></div>
<p><span id="more-3502"></span></p>
<p>The premise seems straightforward: perform a shortest-path analysis from each of several hundred thousand origins to a single destination, Rome, and weight the segment visualizations by the number of routes that include each segment. The resulting map doesn&#8217;t so much answer the question if all roads lead to Rome, but it does provide an beautiful visualization of how you could get to Rome from just about anywhere in Europe.</p>
<p>The project followed up by asking similar questions about the United States. I was most intrigued by the potential state boundaries if drawn using service-area analysis from the state capitals. There was a similar analysis of European countries.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the resulting maps are beautiful and are a great showcase for the analytical and visualization capabilities of the<a href="http://roadstorome.moovellab.com/about"> modern geospatial tools used to produce them</a>. There was a time when this type of analysis would have been the domain of monolithic software with additional add-ons. Those days are thankfully drawing to a close, as illustrated by the Roads to Rome project.</p></p>

  <p class="title"><a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2015/12/01/a-perhaps-premature-recap-of-my-year/">A Perhaps-Premature Recap of My Year</a></p>
  <p class="info">geoMusings<br />Dec 01, 2015 12:54 PM</p>
  <p><p>The calendar is inching up on the nine-year anniversary of this blog and it&#8217;s starting to feel like it&#8217;s been that long since I&#8217;ve actually written anything. It&#8217;s been an interesting year and the last couple of months have been no exception. It&#8217;s probably a bit early for a year-end recap but I feel the need to clear my mind so I can focus on what comes next.</p>
<p>I started the year splitting my time between two projects: one was implementing a geospatial data publication workflow for a US federal civilian agency. I was part of a large team and my role was to work out the ingest, registration, publication of all data types. That project got me elbow-deep in Node, PostGIS, GeoServer, and also gave me some exposure to the <a href="http://www.voyagersearch.com/">Voyager</a> search API. I found the whole experience pretty exciting as we had a really strong implementation team. As a result, I learned a lot and , hopefully, was able to teach a few things along the way. It was the kind of experience you hope every project can be. My involvement wound down toward the middle of the year.</p>
<p><img class="imgCenter aligncenter wp-image-3499 size-full" src="http://i1.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/dollins_st2.png?resize=700%2C207" alt="dollins_st2" srcset="http://i1.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/dollins_st2.png?resize=300%2C89 300w, http://i1.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/dollins_st2.png?resize=1024%2C303 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1651px) 100vw, 1651px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><span id="more-3495"></span>The other project I was working on was, and is, for a long-standing customer supporting one of their key applications that&#8217;s built on a legacy technology stack. I was specifically tasked with integrating some external application services into their core system architecture and with exposing some of their services in a manner compliant with a government-produced system called the &#8220;<a href="http://ozone-development.github.io/ozone-website/owf.html">Ozone Widget Framework</a>&#8221; (OWF). That kept me current with .Net while keeping a foot in the JavaScript world. Interestingly, our customer was recently directed to migrate to a full open-source implementation so my worlds are converging as we plan a transition away from Microsoft and Esri technologies.</p>
<p>The latter half of the year hasn&#8217;t involved much geospatial work for me. I&#8217;ve experienced those cycles in the past since complex systems often have many non-geospatial requirements that will take priority any different points in the lifecycle. I&#8217;ve managed over the year to stay active in that area in a couple of ways. First, I attended the <a href="http://geoint2015.com/">GEOINT Symposium</a> for the first time in my career and found it pretty interesting. Much of the subject matter was very reminiscent of topics in hot debate last decade but there&#8217;s been a plethora of new technologies developed to smooth many of the cumbersome workflows we dealt with then. I was surprised, however, at how much I had retained despite a few years away from direct involvement in that area.</p>
<p>I also had the opportunity to attend two small, one-day conferences: JS.GEO, <a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2015/10/16/a-brief-recap-of-js-geo/">which I have written about previously</a>, and the <a href="https://satsummit.io/">Satellite Summit</a> (SatSummit), hosted by Mapbox. In all of my years in geospatial, I&#8217;ve kept earth observation and its related technologies and workflows at arm&#8217;s length, preferring instead to work with vector data in my applications. I once had a coworker who said you were either a &#8220;pixel pusher&#8221; or a &#8220;vector bender&#8221; and I&#8217;ve always fallen into the latter category. As a result, SatSummit was a bit of a firehose for me and I learned a lot. The disruption that small satellites are having in what has traditionally been a fairly staid market segment is compelling. There was really too much to cover in one post but it&#8217;s an area I plan to delve into more. Suffice it to say that I&#8217;m happy I went.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also been involved in the advisory board of <a href="http://geohipster.com/">GeoHipster</a>. This a has been a great way to work with professionals in the geospatial industry with whom I would not normally get the opportunity. It&#8217;s been fun experiencing the energy behind it and it&#8217;s been a great window into community-building. I also dipped a toe into academia this year by teaching a course, which I am preparing to reprise this spring.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve continued some long-standing work I&#8217;ve been doing with <a href="http://brightrain.com/">David Puckett</a>, developing a monitoring and evaluation system for an NGO. That&#8217;s been fascinating work for a couple of years, giving us insight into the operations of the development community. The nice part is that the system is at the point where we are implementing features that they&#8217;ve wanted for a long time and it&#8217;s rewarding to see the value it adds to their business insight. This system has &#8220;just enough geo&#8221; to be useful without it becoming the 800-pound gorilla. I&#8217;ve done back-end API development while Dave has worked his UX magic. The time-to-market on this project has run rings around most federal work I&#8217;ve done and it&#8217;s been exciting to deliver working, useful code rapidly and often.</p>
<p>So, it&#8217;s been a fairly diverse year. I get the sense that all of this is building toward something but I can&#8217;t quite get the shape of it yet. I&#8217;m certain it will come into clearer focus and, until it does, there&#8217;s no shortage of opportunities to explore.</p></p>

  <p class="info">Spatially Adjusted<br />Nov 06, 2015 09:52 AM</p>
  <p><p>I&#8217;ve been playing with ArcGIS for Server 10.3.1 at Matrix and we&#8217;re all about running things with hosted services.  So rather than spec out some hardware and install ArcGIS for Server on local legacy machines, we&#8217;re doing it all in the cloud.  Because I&#8217;m new here there wasn&#8217;t any legacy AWS use so I was able to pick Azure for deployment.  My logic:</p>
<ul>
<li>While I&#8217;m experienced with AWS, Azure is mostly an unknown world to me.  Given we&#8217;re running Windows servers with SQL Server, why not go native.</li>
<li>I really want to give SQL Azure a spin.</li>
<li>The portal for Azure is much nicer than AWS.  They have those stupid panels in places<a href="#footnote-1-7546" id="note-1-7546" rel="footnote">1</a> but mostly it makes logical sense.</li>
<li>Esri has Cloud Builder to simplify installation which I though would be great for starting up prototypes quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>So logical, no?  Well late yesterday this tweet went out by me.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">/me We should try ArcGIS Server on Azure&#10;/me Seems easy enough&#10;/process fail&#10;/me should have known</p>

<p>I was stuck here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CloudBuilder_Fail.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7547" src="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CloudBuilder_Fail.png" alt="CloudBuilder_Fail" width="810" height="689" /></a></p>
<p>You can literally hear the sad trombone sound.  Now <a href="https://twitter.com/s_libby">Sam Libby</a> was helping troubleshoot but things were still a bit weird.  Basically as you can see in the error above, I needed to accept an EULA.  Now of course I went into the the Azure Marketplace and followed the instructions to allow the Esri VM to be deployed programmatically which is what Cloud Builder requires.  But each time it errored out the same way.</p>
<p>Sam offered this:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/cageyjames">@cageyjames</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Esri">@Esri</a> Run the image from the Azure console and then remote in and apple the license yourself &#8212; as a workaround?</p>

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Basically he hit upon it.  Microsoft did something with the marketplace and for whatever reason the Cloud Builder app won&#8217;t install an Esri ArcGIS for Server VM until you actually install it first yourself.</p>
<p>The workaround to get the Cloud Builder app to run is actually just create a VM using the Azure Portal then delete it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/create_vm.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7549" src="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/create_vm.png" alt="create_vm" width="904" height="783" /></a></p>
<p>After that, the Esri Cloud Builder app runs perfectly without trouble.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cloudbuilder.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7548" src="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cloudbuilder.png" alt="cloudbuilder" width="799" height="687" /></a></p>

<p>So the ArcGIS <del>for</del> Server Cloud Builder<a href="#footnote-2-7546" id="note-2-7546" rel="footnote">2</a> works great.  While I don&#8217;t like wizards in general, it automates the processes that take time and let&#8217;s you focus on the settings for ArcGIS for Server you want to change.  I honestly haven&#8217;t installed ArcGIS for Server since it was ArcGIS Server (without the for) 9.3.1 and it was interesting to see how things have changed and how little has actually changed.</p>

  <p class="title"><a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/apple-gets-ready-to-release-indoor-positioning-service/">Apple Gets Ready to Release Indoor Positioning Service</a></p>
  <p class="info">Spatially Adjusted<br />Nov 02, 2015 08:40 AM</p>
  <p><p>Over the weekend Apple apparently <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/11/02/apple-indoor-positioning-app-indoor-survey-spotted-on-ios-app-store">pushed out an indoor positioning app</a> &#8216;<a href="http://appleinsider.com/l/?link=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id994269367?mt=8">Indoor Survey</a>&#8216; into the iOS App Store.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;By dropping &#8216;points&#8217; on a map within the Survey App, you indicate your position within the venue as you walk through,&#8221; <a href="http://appleinsider.com/l/?link=https://itunes.apple.com/app/id994269367?mt=8">reads the app description</a>. &#8220;As you do so, the indoor Survey App measures the radio frequency (RF) signal data and combines it with an iPhone&#8217;s sensor data. The end result is indoor positioning without the need to install special hardware.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Interesting in the sense it appears to be an app that stores can use to map their interiors with iOS devices.  It&#8217;s not a crowd sourced indoor mapping application.  This dovetails nicely with the other announcement <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/11/02/apple-pushes-maps-indoor-service-to-venue-owners-limited-to-high-traffic-spots">this morning about their new Maps Indoor service</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>For now, Apple is focusing its efforts on a handful of venues that meet specific criteria. These requirements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The venue must be accessible to the general public</li>
<li>Only locations that draw more than a million visitors per year</li>
<li>Apple requires &#8220;complete, accurate, and scaled reference maps&#8221; for consideration</li>
<li>The venue must have Wi-Fi throughout, and an official app available on the App Store</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The groundwork is set for Apple to start mapping interiors of these large open venues.  But with an app and an iPhone, clearly Apple is planning to scale this out to just about every indoor location.  I suspect we&#8217;ll see stadiums, amusement parks and other entertainment venues appear first over the next year.</p>

<p>Well I&#8217;ve ended up at <a href="http://www.matrixneworld.com">Matrix New World Engineering</a> as the National Practice Leader for GIS and Geospatial Services.  I&#8217;m going to miss the guys at AECOM and working as Project Manager on the BLM Navigator<a href="#footnote-1-7532" id="note-1-7532" rel="footnote">1</a> data sharing portal but the opportunity with Matrix is something I could not pass up.  In a twist, I will be working more closely with Esri technology.  That means you&#8217;ll see me blogging more about Esri again.  That said the first program I bought at Matrix was Safe FME Desktop so you can see my overall goals aren&#8217;t changing.</p>
<p>Tied in with this is ArcGIS for Server on Azure.  I&#8217;m jumping in with two feet it appears.  But don&#8217;t worry, you won&#8217;t be seeing any ArcObjects or Dojo posts from me.  It&#8217;s interesting to try to get back on where Esri server software has gone over the past 5 years I&#8217;ve ignored it.  Google searches of course make me laugh a bit.</p>

<p>The bottom goals don&#8217;t change though.  Sharing data and liberating data from silos.  Making smart choices with open source technology and embracing Python and JavaScript over Java and .NET.  My Esri account is locked out of ArcGIS Online (who even knows how to get that fixed) so step one is cleaning out the garage<a href="#footnote-2-7532" id="note-2-7532" rel="footnote">2</a> in my mind.</p>
<p>Now I had promised Hangouts with James Fee starting back mid-October.  Well given my job change it was difficult to get that started back up.  It&#8217;s being pushed back to November and my first guest will be the always interesting Ian White.  Stay tuned for the schedule.</p>

  <p class="info">geoMusings<br />Oct 16, 2015 02:04 PM</p>
  <p><p>Last week, I attended the <a href="http://www.jsgeo.com/">JS.GEO</a> event in Philadelphia. In this post, I offer a brief recap of what I saw. It is brief for two reasons. First, it has already been <a href="http://derekswingley.com/2015/10/13/notes-from-js-geo-2015/">ably</a> <a href="http://cesiumjs.org/2015/10/09/JSGEO-Trip-Report/">covered</a> in detail by others. I went on family-related travel immediately afterward and could not sit down to collect my thoughts until the latter part of this week. The existing posts cover the blow-by-blow well. Second, due to the aforementioned travel, I had to leave the event shortly after lunch.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to first state that the event was very professionally coordinated and organized by <a href="https://twitter.com/cwhelm">Chris Helm</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/briantimoney">Brian Timoney</a>. The choice of Philadelphia was a masterstroke as it is easily accessible from Boston to Richmond. The venue was a short walk from the train station so getting to it took only slightly longer than a regular commute by car into DC. <a href="http://www.zekiah.com">My company</a> was one of the sponsors and we are happy to have supported it. We&#8217;ve made quiet use of varying permutations of JavaScript and geospatial tools for well over a decade and felt like sponsoring JS.GEO was a good way to give back and support the community.</p>
<p>The one-day, no-fluff model of JS.GEO is one that should be emulated more often. The small time commitment makes it easy to fit into a schedule and the low cost is accessible to a wide variety of budgets (student, local government, etc.). The tight schedule was a positive to me. There was a lot of good technical content without a lot of the marketing fluff that comes with other, larger industry events. The fact that that JS.GEO is vendor and philosophy-neutral is refreshing. While there is a heavy contingent of open-source tools being discussed, it is not specifically an open-source (or closed-source, for that matter) event. Those types of outlooks were checked at the door and the pace of the content didn&#8217;t really allow them to surface. As a result, the audience was able to focus on the merits of the solutions and approaches being presented. Our industry could use more of that.</p>
<p>As for the content itself, I will discuss it thematically. When I attended the first JS.GEO three years ago, JavaScript was already in wide use in the geospatial community, with plug-ins quickly on their way out. <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> was on the radar but I wouldn&#8217;t have called it ubiquitous at that time. There were numerous applications shown and discussions of various JavaScript frameworks and an observer could see an upward trend.</p>
<p>This year&#8217;s event makes it clear that JS.GEO is no longer the name of an event but rather a proven stack implementation concept. Node is clearly the application server of choice and this year&#8217;s talks featured some that discussed full devops and deployment workflows. The applications shown were not cobbled together from frameworks but were quite recognizable to anyone who has deployed enterprise-scale applications using other technologies. JavaScript has come a long way in the geospatial community in a very short time.</p>
<p>This kind of rapid change is bound to shake things up a bit, which brings me to a technology that did not exist at the first JS.GEO but was ubiquitous at this year&#8217;s event: <a href="http://turfjs.org/">Turf</a>. Usable on either the server (Node) or in the browser, Turf provides advanced spatial analysis capability, with the ability to do so in the browser being the most appealing to me. Turf was mentioned so often in the presentations I saw that I began to wonder if I was at a landscaping convention. It&#8217;s been on my to-do list for a while but I cracked it open since I&#8217;ve gotten home and plan to rework some previous applications to use Turf.</p>
<p>My brief stay at JS.GEO was informative and motivating. Thanks to Chris, Brian, all of the presenters, and all of the other sponsors for making it such a worthwhile event. I am looking forward to next year.</p></p>

  <p class="info">geoMusings<br />Oct 05, 2015 10:00 AM</p>
  <p><p>Earlier this year, I joined the newly-formed <a href="http://geohipster.com/advisory-board/">advisory board</a> for the web site <a href="http://geohipster.com/">GeoHipster</a>. The site, and specifically the Q&amp;A interview format with people working throughout the geospatial industry, had rapidly developed an audience and the logistics had outpaced the ability of the site&#8217;s founder, <a href="https://twitter.com/atanas">Atanas Entchev</a>, to keep up. So a group of us signed on to help out. As a result, many of us have contributed interviews and helped Atanas manage the direction of the site.</p>
<p>One thing that became clear to me even before joining the advisory board was that Atanas was taking a tongue-in-cheek approach to the &#8220;hipster&#8221; label. He was simply having fun with a prevailing cultural meme. The content of the site, however, belied a desire to celebrate the work being done throughout the industry. I admired that interviewees often had clearly strong opinions on issues and that Atanas, while staking no specific positions for the site itself, did not attempt to buff away the hard edges of these opinions. I have found the site&#8217;s content refreshingly honest and often fun, which is why I wanted to get involved.</p>
<p>Last year, GeoHipster introduced a number of mechanisms to help defray the costs of running the site. These included sponsorship (Thanks, <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>!), <a href="http://geohipster.com/become-a-patron/">patronage</a>, and the sale of merchandise such as calendars and t-shirts. The calendar was a particularly fun showcase of the artistry of the geospatial industry and GeoHipster is reprising it for 2016.</p>
<p>Last week, the site published a <a href="http://geohipster.com/2016-geohipster-calendar/">call for maps for the 2016 GeoHipster calendar</a>. We&#8217;ve already seen a great response and are looking forward to more. There is a lot of imagination in our industry and the maps we&#8217;ve seen so far reflect that. The calendar is a great way to showcase your art so I encourage anyone to send a submission. The advisory board would like nothing more than for the job of selecting 13 maps to be as difficult as possible.</p>
<p>The sales of the calendars help keep the site running. GeoHipster is not a nonprofit but it is certainly not profitable. The costs of operating the site include obvious things such as hosting and design work but also include the costs of sending a free t-shirt to each interviewee and the distribution of the stickers that have become a fixture on geospatial laptops across the world. So your maps will help keep a good thing going. If you&#8217;ve enjoyed reading GeoHipster this year, and you feel you have strong cartographic skills, I encourage you to submit a map.</p></p>

  <p class="info">geoMusings<br />Sep 16, 2015 04:10 PM</p>
  <p><p>I saw this tweet today from Lyzi Diamond and I found the question intriguing. My answer was reference back to one of her posts, <a href="http://lyzidiamond.com/posts/osgeo-august-meeting/">concerning the use of link relations to add GeoJSON data to Leaflet</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What has been your biggest “a-ha!” moment while learning mapping technology? What resource gave it to you? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gistribe?src=hash">#gistribe</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Lyzi Diamond (@lyzidiamond) <a href="https://twitter.com/lyzidiamond/status/644234193707204609">September 16, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The post is an oldie but a goodie and I didn&#8217;t reference it to butter Lyzi up. Although I have moved on from the technique she describes in that post (and you can follow the post updates to see that she has, too), it started me down a line of thinking that has changed the way I approach my consulting work.</p>
<p>As something of a greybeard (literally and figuratively), I can sometimes fall into the trap of relying too heavily on &#8220;design patterns&#8221; that are really nothing more than tried-and-true habits. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with using patterns <em>per se</em>, as long as you remember to occasionally look up to see what else is going on. I had unknowingly fallen into the pattern of assuming &#8220;map server&#8221; (term used generically) for any web mapping application I was designing. The options for that place in the &#8220;stack&#8221; were pretty varied but I didn&#8217;t question the need for one so much as which one I would use.</p>
<p>Lyzi&#8217;s post got me exploring the concept of building interactive mapping applications with static content, as well as when that would be appropriate, and identifying the thresholds and parameters beyond which you would need to go with a map server. I&#8217;ve come to realize that most of the workflows of my customers over the years would have lent themselves well to such an approach, if the technology had been there to support it.</p>
<p>Where it is appropriate to use static content, there are even distinct advantages for performance, caching, and security. For example, not having a live link to a database server and not having additional mapping technologies to patch and maintain makes IT staff very happy. And, of course, you&#8217;re letting web servers do what web servers do.</p>
<p>So, essentially, my first question when starting a mapping application changed from &#8220;What map server do we use?&#8221; to &#8220;Do we need to use a map server?&#8221; If I can prototype mapping capability using only GitHub or NGINX, I probably proceed without a map server. It helps that <a href="http://turfjs.org/">new technologies</a> are coming online all the time that continue to make it easier to proceed without one.</p>
<p>Map servers do provide some compelling capability and should be considered in any proper system design evaluation, but it should no longer automatically be assumed that one is required in order to deliver a rich interactive web mapping application.</p></p>

  <p class="info">Spatially Adjusted<br />Sep 10, 2015 03:52 PM</p>
  <p><p>Back in June, <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/blog/series-b/">Mapbox received their Series B round of $52.55M</a>.  With that, Mapbox has turned up their development on just about everything and had a grand old-time at the Esri UC buying just about every advertising space outside the San Diego Convention Center.  At the time Eric said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re creating the building blocks for a complete mapping stack. This extends way beyond a map.</p></blockquote>
<p>Today CartoDB has <a href="http://blog.cartodb.com/announcement-seriesb/">announced their Series B</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are excited to announce the close of $23 million in Series B financing to expand CartoDB’s mission, enabling anyone to map their world’s data and leverage the power of location.</p>
<p>This moment is truly important because it sends a strong message about the location intelligence revolution as renowned investors validate our position and direction in this growing market. I would like to acknowledge the hard work done by many people in the company in the process — you guys rock!</p></blockquote>
<p>Spatial IT is hot stuff right now.  That&#8217;s about $75M in Series B funding in little over 2 months.  Bubble?  Probably not as you can&#8217;t really say either company hasn&#8217;t developed a business and has important clients.  5 years ago there were much more spatial startups running around trying to get money, from GeoIQ and SimpleGeo to WeoGeo<a href="#footnote-1-7518" id="note-1-7518" rel="footnote">1</a> and Geoloqi all received some funding but ended up being acquired mostly for staff or client lists.  CartoDB and Mapbox are of a different beast and their sustainability has been rewarded by large investments.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s going on with CartoDB now?  It appears they&#8217;re going to continue investing in the core product and make it bigger and easier to work with.  I&#8217;m excited for them, the elephant is going for a ride!</p>

  <p class="info">geoMusings<br />Sep 10, 2015 10:17 AM</p>
  <p><p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2737" src="http://i2.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/cartodb_spatial_query.png?resize=700%2C340" alt="cartodb_spatial_query" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p>I was happy to read to day that <a href="https://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a> closed a <a href="http://blog.cartodb.com/announcement-seriesb/">$23 million Series B financing round</a>. I&#8217;ve been impressed with CartoDB since I first saw it in action at FOSS4G in Denver in 2011. I&#8217;ve done a few posts on using the platform, which are starting to get long in the tooth but are still valid. I still find it one of the easiest post-GeoIQ ways to quickly host spatial data and build mapping applications. I probably need to spend a little time getting re-acqainted with the platform.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s news follows the announcement over the summer of <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/17/mapbox-raises-52-6m-led-by-dfj-to-build-the-map-layer-for-all-apps/">additional funding received by Mapbox</a>. Both platforms attempt to tackle the problem of hosting large amounts of geospatial data and making it available for visualization and integration using means that are consistent with modern web technologies and techniques. If one were to draw a functional Venn diagram, it would probably show a lot of overlap, though each platform&#8217;s technical implementation is unique.</p>
<p>While it is valid for one to <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/08/is-silicon-valley-in-another-bubble">question whether the tech market in general is entering another &#8220;bubble&#8221; phase</a>, both of these investments and the previous rounds that preceded them for both Mapbox and CartoDB, indicate to me that the tech market still has an interest in location, and perhaps even advanced, GIS-like location analytics, that has not been fully met.</p>
<p>I have often stated that I think industry generally recognizes the value of location, while the value of GIS is not as readily apparent. The continued investment in modern location platforms, despite the existence and availability of mature GIS platforms, does nothing to dissuade me from this observation. For whatever reason, tech industry investors continue to look at what is currently available and opt to continue building something new.</p></p>

  <p class="info">Spatially Adjusted<br />Sep 09, 2015 11:34 AM</p>
  <p><p>10 years ago, Google Earth was still somewhat unknown.  It had its big coming out party with a natural disaster<a href="#footnote-1-7502" id="note-1-7502" rel="footnote">1</a> and people started doing amazing things with it.  If there was one person back in 2005 that knew XML spatial formats, it was Ron Lake.  He wrote a <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/ron-lake-what-is-kml/">commentary on KML</a> 10 years ago this week.  I for one read his article with 10 years of time to think about they implications of KML and see why from his perspective KML was not able to handle his needs.</p>
<p>Back then we all thought KML was the future and there wasn&#8217;t much that couldn&#8217;t be done.  I think now we all realize that KML is the new PDF except we knew that <a href="http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/phillip-holmstrand-kmz-is-becoming-the-geographic-equivalent-of-the-pdf/">10 years ago</a>.  XML of course is never the answer&#8230;</p>

  <p class="title"><a href="http://blog.geomusings.com/2015/08/19/desktop-gis/">Desktop GIS</a></p>
  <p class="info">geoMusings<br />Aug 19, 2015 11:18 AM</p>
  <p><p>I&#8217;ve found myself using desktop GIS more and more lately. While I don&#8217;t tend to think of myself as an analyst and I&#8217;ll never be confused with a cartographer, it is simply not possible to perform GIS software development without making occasional use of desktop GIS. My typical use cases involve data preparation or query verification or similar such tasks to prove out some logic before I commit it to my application code. The screenshot below depicts my default desktop GIS configuration:</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Ubuntu_12.04_terminal_fi.png"><img class="imgCenter aligncenter wp-image-3454" src="http://i1.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Ubuntu_12.04_terminal_fi.png?resize=422%2C270" alt="Ubuntu_12.04_terminal_fi" srcset="http://i1.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Ubuntu_12.04_terminal_fi.png?resize=300%2C192 300w, http://i1.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Ubuntu_12.04_terminal_fi.png?w=724 724w" sizes="(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Yes, I have come full circle back to command-line GIS. After years of fiddling with the latest Arc/Q-GUI-du-jour, I find myself spending most of my time working with a flashing cursor.</p>
<p><span id="more-3453"></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve hit a point in my career where I pretty much know what I need to do for any given task. The command-line gives me the most direct access to the tasks I want to perform without hunting and pecking through toolbars and icons.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s taken a while, but there&#8217;s now a host of tools to work with. Ones that I commonly find myself using are the PostgreSQL command prompt to use <a href="http://postgis.net/" target="_blank">PostGIS </a>functions, <a href="http://www.gdal.org/" target="_blank">GDAL/OGR</a>, and also some Python or Javascript scripting with <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely" target="_blank">Shapely</a>/<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Fiona" target="_blank">Fiona </a>or <a href="http://turfjs.org/" target="_blank">Turf</a>. Of those, I spend the vast majority of my time in PostgreSQL. PostGIS simply does most of what I need, giving me a command-line GIS capability I haven&#8217;t had since the ARC/INFO days.</p>
<p>I should probably state that it&#8217;s impossible to completely kick GUI desktops. There&#8217;s still no better way to design a map product, and they are still useful for visualizing complex query outputs that may be difficult to interpret from a terminal dump. For that reason, I still have <a href="http://www.qgis.org/en/site/" target="_blank">QGIS </a>handy and can always re-activate my ArcMap license if needed. But I find that my visualization needs can be pretty well suited by a &#8220;studio&#8221; type of application such as <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/" target="_blank">TileMill </a>(which I still use and love) or <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio" target="_blank">Mapbox Studio</a> (which I&#8217;m getting used to).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been another great, languid East Coast summer and I&#8217;ve been intentionally laying low. The autumn will ramp up as the local work force shuffles back into town and the geospatial event circuit heats up. I expect it to bring a lot of activity and change, along with a corresponding uptick in posts here.</p></p>

  <p class="info">geoMusings<br />Jul 23, 2015 10:06 AM</p>
  <p><p>Just prior to heading out of town for vacation, I noticed that the <a href="http://www.jsgeo.com/">JS.Geo 2015 site</a> went live. This year&#8217;s event has moved east to Philadelphia and is being held on October 8, 2015. The date is the Thursday before Columbus Day weekend so it will be a great transition into a long weekend, especially for a lot of DC and Baltimore-area developers. The venue looks to be about a 15-minute walk from the 30th Street Amtrak station, so it&#8217;s convenient for developers from Richmond to Boston.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/jsgeo13.png"><img class="imgCenter aligncenter wp-image-3449 size-full" src="http://i2.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/jsgeo13.png?resize=437%2C186" alt="jsgeo13" srcset="http://i2.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/jsgeo13.png?resize=300%2C128 300w, http://i2.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/jsgeo13.png?w=437 437w" sizes="(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-3448"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.zekiah.com">My company</a> joined as a sponsor this year. We are doing more with this technology mix as our government customers come around, and we feel that focused, vendor-independent, events such as JS.Geo are an important learning resource. The approach of JS.Geo is something I&#8217;d like to see applied to other technical areas because I think the low cost and limited time commitment make the event very accessible to everyone from students to government staff that may be fighting limited travel budgets. The content of past events has been top-notch and the speakers already lined up are an indication that this one will keep with that tradition.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t recommend JS.Geo enough. If you can spare a day in October, I strongly recommend attending.</p></p>

  <p class="info">geoMusings<br />Jul 16, 2015 03:57 PM</p>
  <p><p>This post is a little bit off-topic from my typical fare. I recently returned from the <a href="http://www.childrenwithdiabetes.com/activities/Orlando2015/">Children with Diabetes Friends for Life</a> conference. During one of the lunches, a group of parents at a table were discussing the common difficulty in getting in touch with your child, given that most everyone keeps their mobile phone silenced. I had a specific diabetes-related issue with my child where this situation came into play, so I set out to find (or build, if needed) a solution. Luckily the solution presented itself quickly in the form of the <a href="http://automateitapp.com/">AutomateIt Android app</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AutomateIt.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3434" src="http://i2.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AutomateIt.png?resize=700%2C342" alt="AutomateIt" srcset="http://i2.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AutomateIt.png?resize=300%2C146 300w, http://i2.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AutomateIt.png?w=705 705w" sizes="(max-width: 705px) 100vw, 705px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p><span id="more-3433"></span></p>
<p>I explained to the parent I was sitting with that I installed the app on my child&#8217;s phone and could now send a text message that would set the phone into audible mode. I can also send a text message to get the specific latitude/longitude location of the phone as well (in the event of non-response). This latter function isn&#8217;t &#8220;spying&#8221; since the text messages are clearly visible on the phone. It&#8217;s important to discuss these safety measures ahead of time. Given that we were sitting at lunch, I&#8217;m sure I didn&#8217;t explain it well so this post is intended as a resource for anyone who wants to be able to place the phone of a loved one into audible mode. The step-by-step follows (please note that the red rectangles in the screen shots were added by me for emphasis):</p>
<p>Step 1: Install the app on your child&#8217;s phone. It&#8217;s available through Google Play and does not require rooting your phone. Everything that I discuss in this post can be done with the free version.</p>
<p>Step 2: Start the app and begin creating a rule by tapping &#8220;Add Rule.&#8221;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 3: Choose the &#8220;SMS With Text&#8221; trigger.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/automateit2.png"><img class="imgCenter aligncenter wp-image-3437 size-large" src="http://i1.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/automateit2.png?resize=576%2C1024" alt="automateit2" srcset="http://i1.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/automateit2.png?resize=576%2C1024 576w, http://i1.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/automateit2.png?w=1080 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 4: Define the text which will trigger the action. It should be something that wouldn&#8217;t commonly appear in a text message. I typically use a hash tag of some kind (such as #soundon in this example).</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/automateit3.png"><img class="imgCenter aligncenter wp-image-3438 size-large" src="http://i1.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/automateit3.png?resize=576%2C1024" alt="automateit3" srcset="http://i1.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/automateit3.png?resize=576%2C1024 576w, http://i1.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/automateit3.png?w=1080 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 5: Choose &#8220;Set Volume Action.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/automateit4.png"><img class="imgCenter aligncenter wp-image-3439 size-large" src="http://i0.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/automateit4.png?resize=576%2C1024" alt="automateit4" srcset="http://i0.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/automateit4.png?resize=576%2C1024 576w, http://i0.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/automateit4.png?w=1080 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 6: Set the volume thresholds. You probably mostly care about the ringer and notifications. I max out everything.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/automateit5.png"><img class="imgCenter aligncenter wp-image-3440 size-large" src="http://i1.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/automateit5.png?resize=576%2C1024" alt="automateit5" srcset="http://i1.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/automateit5.png?resize=576%2C1024 576w, http://i1.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/automateit5.png?w=1080 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 7: Give the rule a name (&#8220;Sound On&#8221; in this example) and then save it my tapping the disk icon.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/automateit6.png"><img class="imgCenter aligncenter wp-image-3441 size-large" src="http://i2.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/automateit6.png?resize=576%2C1024" alt="automateit6" srcset="http://i2.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/automateit6.png?resize=576%2C1024 576w, http://i2.wp.com/blog.geomusings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/automateit6.png?w=1080 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the above process will ensure that you can make your child&#8217;s phone audible in the event that you need to follow up for any of a number of reasons. The app is currently only available on Android and I haven&#8217;t researched iPhone alternatives.</p></p>
